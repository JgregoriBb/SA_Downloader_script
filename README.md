# Submission downloader script for Blackboard Learn.

This script runs through Blackboard Learn Courses and downloads student sumbissions for assessesments that have the Safeassign anti-plagiarisim tool enabled. A folder is created for each assignment and the user Id is included in the file name for further processing. 

This script has not been tested for windows computers.

> :warning: This script now supports Original (Classic) and Ultra courses, however, it does consume more API calls, when using in production, make sure to contact Blackboard Support and request the API call rate to be raised (default for dev apps is 10k)

## Setup

This script was created in Python 3, make sure python3 is installed and working in your system. Here are the steps to make it work.

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
```Python
#env creation
python3 -m venv env

#env activation
source env/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies, either from 'requirements.txt' or manually.
```Python
#dependencies from requeriments.txt
pip3 -r requeriments.txt

#dependencies manually
pip3 install Bb-rest-helper
pip3 install jupyter
````
5. In the developer portal, register a new application and retrieve the KEY and SECRET values. Configure this application in Learn with an user with sufficient priviledges to 
    
    * Read course information.
    * Read assessment information.
    * Read attempt information

>:warning: Do NOT use an admin user to register your application!

>:warning: Make sure to log a ticket to raise the API rate
